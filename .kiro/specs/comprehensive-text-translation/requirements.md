# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a comprehensive text translation system for the NisaRide Flutter application. The system will ensure that all user-facing text elements throughout the application are properly localized and can be dynamically translated between supported languages (English, Urdu, and Arabic). This includes identifying untranslated text, completing missing translations, implementing proper localization infrastructure, and ensuring consistent translation quality across all app screens and components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Translation Coverage

**User Story:** As a user, I want all text in the application to be available in my preferred language, so that I can fully understand and use the app without language barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches to any supported language THEN all visible text elements SHALL be displayed in the selected language
2. WHEN the app loads THEN no hardcoded English text SHALL appear in non-English language modes
3. WHEN navigating through all app screens THEN every text element SHALL have a corresponding translation key
4. IF a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL display a fallback text with clear indication of missing translation
5. WHEN new features are added THEN all text elements SHALL be immediately available in all supported languages

### Requirement 2: Translation Quality and Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want translations to be accurate and consistent throughout the app, so that the user experience feels professional and coherent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing translated text THEN the translation SHALL be contextually appropriate and grammatically correct
2. WHEN the same term appears in different screens THEN it SHALL use consistent translation across the app
3. WHEN technical terms are used THEN they SHALL follow established localization conventions for each language
4. WHEN currency, dates, and numbers are displayed THEN they SHALL follow the formatting conventions of the selected language
5. WHEN text direction changes (RTL for Arabic/Urdu) THEN the layout SHALL properly accommodate the text direction

### Requirement 3: Translation Management System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an efficient system to manage translations, so that I can easily add, update, and maintain translations across all supported languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new text THEN the translation key SHALL follow a consistent naming convention
2. WHEN updating translations THEN changes SHALL be reflected immediately without app restart
3. WHEN a translation key is missing THEN the system SHALL log the missing key for developer attention
4. WHEN translations are updated THEN the system SHALL validate that all languages have corresponding entries
5. WHEN managing translations THEN developers SHALL have tools to identify incomplete or missing translations

### Requirement 4: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want language switching to be fast and seamless, so that I can change languages without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching languages THEN the change SHALL take effect within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the app starts THEN the previously selected language SHALL be remembered and applied
3. WHEN translations load THEN the app performance SHALL not be significantly impacted
4. WHEN using the app in any language THEN the user interface SHALL remain responsive and smooth
5. WHEN text is displayed THEN there SHALL be no visible text flickering or layout shifts during language changes

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Screen Coverage

**User Story:** As a user, I want every screen and component in the app to support my language preference, so that I have a consistent experience throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing authentication screens THEN all text SHALL be properly translated
2. WHEN using dashboard and navigation elements THEN all labels and messages SHALL be in the selected language
3. WHEN viewing ride management screens THEN all status messages and labels SHALL be translated
4. WHEN accessing profile and settings screens THEN all options and descriptions SHALL be in the selected language
5. WHEN using wallet and transaction features THEN all financial terms and messages SHALL be properly localized
6. WHEN viewing error messages and notifications THEN they SHALL appear in the user's selected language
7. WHEN using chat and communication features THEN interface elements SHALL be translated while preserving message content
